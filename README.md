# Heartbeat detection

Set of scripts to detect heartbeat


## Preparing to launch

### Install all dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

If you're using windows do not forget to add extra argument for pip for gpu support:

```bash
--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
```

**NOTE**: numbers in "_cu116_" may vary from time to time or system to system, if this does not work go to [pytorch official site](https://pytorch.org/) to get correct link for prebuilt binaries
